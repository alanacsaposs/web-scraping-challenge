# Web Scraping Challenge â€” Mission to Mars

A web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in an HTML page.

App sources information from:

[NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/)

[JPL Featured Space Image](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars)

[Mars Weather Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en)

[Mars Facts Webpage](https://space-facts.com/mars/)

[USGS Astrogeology Site](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)

Final app includes two pages, an index and a scrape page. The scrape page runs the web scrape function, and acts as the final landing page for all data and includes a "Scrape Again" button to re-scrape information.
